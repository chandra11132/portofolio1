              <h3>Web Developer - Smp 2 Sabak Auh & Smk Metta Maitreya</h3>
                <p>
                  I was first introduced to HTML and CSS during my early years in high school.
                  I remember being fascinated by how simple lines of code could create visually appealing web pages.
                  My journey began with basic HTML tags and learning how to structure a webpage.
                  As I progressed, I delved into CSS to style my pages, experimenting with colors, fonts, and layouts. The ability to transform plain text into a beautiful website was incredibly rewarding and fueled my passion for web development. This foundational knowledge has been crucial in my growth as a developer, allowing me to build more complex and interactive websites over time.
